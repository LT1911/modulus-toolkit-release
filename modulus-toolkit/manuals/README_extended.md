## 4. DevOps – Deployment & Maintenance  
*(Modules 5 & 6: `5-devops-info.psm1` and `6-devops-admin.psm1`)*

The DevOps chapter is designed to help with the staging ("prep") and deployment ("deploy") of updates and maintenance operations for the Galaxis system. It includes functions for cleaning up temporary folders, preparing new releases from source archives, and deploying them to live directories.

### DevOps Info (Module 5)
- **Clear-PrepDir:**  
  Clears out the staging (“prep”) folder to remove any previously prepared files.
- **Clear-LogsDir:**  
  Clears out the logs directory.

### Prep Functions – Staging New Releases  
These functions extract new binaries and configuration files from compressed archives stored in the "sources" folder. They then rearrange the extracted files into a structure expected by the live system.

- **Prep-Galaxis:**  
  Searches for a 7z archive (matching patterns such as `Galaxis*Executable*.7z`) in the sources directory and extracts it into a subfolder within the prep directory (e.g. `Executable only`). Post-extraction, it moves files from deeper subdirectories (like `Server\Galaxis\`) into the correct target folder and cleans up any extraneous directories (such as Docker or installation folders) that are not needed for deployment.
- **Prep-SYSTM:**  
  Has two sub-functions:
  - **Prep-SYSTM-Executables:**  
    Extracts SYSTM executable updates from archives (e.g. matching `SYSTM*Executable*.7z`) and rearranges the file structure for deployment.
  - **Prep-SYSTM-Config:**  
    Extracts configuration file updates for SYSTM from archives (e.g. matching `SYSTM*Config*.7z`) and similarly moves them to the proper directory.
- **Prep-Other:**  
  Handles other files not categorized as executables or configuration files by extracting them from archives matching patterns like `Galaxis*Other*.7z`.
- **Prep-Config:**  
  Specifically extracts configuration updates (archives matching `Galaxis*Config*.7z`), then moves and cleans up the extracted files.
- **Prep-Install / Prep-Web / Prep-CRYSTALControl / Prep-MBoxUI / Prep-PlayWatch:**  
  Similar in concept, these functions extract and stage installer packages, web modules, Crystal Control updates, MBoxUI, and PlayWatch packages respectively. Each uses the common helper function `Extract-7ZipFile` to extract the relevant 7z archives into designated subdirectories within the prep folder and then performs any necessary post-extraction cleanup (such as moving files to flatten the folder structure or removing extraneous folders).

### Deploy Functions – Rolling Out Updates to Live  
Once files have been staged in the prep folder, the deploy functions copy them into the live system directories (e.g., `D:\Galaxis` or `D:\OnlineData`).

- **Deploy-Galaxis:**  
  Uses Robocopy to mirror the contents of the `Executable only`, `Config only`, and `Other` folders from the prep directory to the live Galaxis installation folder. It employs parameters such as `/IM /IS /IT` (to force overwrite) and creates a detailed log file in the logs directory.
- **Deploy-SYSTM:**  
  Contains sub-functions:
  - **Deploy-SYSTM-Executables:**  
    Copies SYSTM executable files from the staging area to the live Galaxis folder using Robocopy, with parameters that force an overwrite.
  - **Deploy-SYSTM-Config:**  
    Deploys configuration files for SYSTM, typically using parameters (e.g. `/XC /XN /XO`) that only copy non-existing or outdated files.
- **Deploy-Web, Deploy-PlayWatch, Deploy-CRYSTALControl, etc.:**  
  These functions similarly use Robocopy to copy staged files (from their respective prep subdirectories) into their live locations. They generate log files, verify the outcome, and provide on-screen output to allow technicians to verify that the correct files have been deployed.

Each deploy function typically:
  - Determines the source folder from the prep directory (using filtering based on folder names such as "Executables", "Config", etc.).
  - Uses Robocopy with appropriate options (which might vary to either force overwrite or only update non-existing files) to copy files into the target live directory.
  - Writes a log file (with a timestamp in the filename) into the logs directory.
  - Displays the tail end of the log file so that the operator can quickly verify the results.

## 4. (Expanded) DevOps – Deployment & Maintenance

This chapter focuses on preparing (staging) and deploying updates. The functions are divided into two primary groups:

### Prep Functions – Staging New Releases

The **prep functions** extract new releases from compressed archives stored in the *sources* directory. They use the common helper `Extract-7ZipFile` to extract files that match a specific pattern (e.g. `Galaxis*Executable*.7z`, `SYSTM*Config*.7z`, etc.). Once extracted, the functions often perform additional operations:
- **Moving Files:**  
  Files extracted into a nested folder (for example, `Server\Galaxis\`) are moved up to a designated folder (e.g. `Executable only` or `Config only`) to ensure a flat folder structure.
- **Cleanup:**  
  Unnecessary directories (such as Docker subfolders or batch installer directories) are removed to leave only the relevant files for deployment.
- **Specific Tasks:**  
  Functions such as `Prep-Galaxis` handle the primary Galaxis executables; `Prep-SYSTM` deals with both executables and configuration files specific to the SYSTM component; `Prep-MBoxUI` and `Prep-PlayWatch` similarly stage updates for their respective modules.

**Key Prep Functions:**
- **Prep-Galaxis:**  
  Extracts and stages Galaxis executables. After extraction, it rearranges the files into the expected folder structure and removes any unnecessary subdirectories.
- **Prep-SYSTM:**  
  Divided into `Prep-SYSTM-Executables` (for binary updates) and `Prep-SYSTM-Config` (for configuration updates). Both functions ensure that the files are organized correctly in the prep directory.
- **Prep-Other & Prep-Config:**  
  These functions stage miscellaneous files (which do not fall under executables) and configuration files respectively.
- **Prep-Install, Prep-Web, Prep-CRYSTALControl, Prep-MBoxUI, Prep-PlayWatch:**  
  Specialized functions for staging installer packages, web modules, and updates for specific applications. They all follow the same pattern: extract using a defined file pattern, move the files into the proper subdirectory, and perform cleanup operations.

### Deploy Functions – Rolling Out Updates to Live

After the new packages are staged in the prep folder, the **deploy functions** copy them from the staging area to the live system directories using Robocopy.

- **Deploy-Galaxis:**  
  Copies the contents from the prep folders (for executables, configuration, and other files) to the live Galaxis installation directory (typically `D:\Galaxis`). It uses options like `/IM /IS /IT` (which force overwrite) and logs detailed output to a log file.
- **Deploy-SYSTM:**  
  Contains sub-functions for executables and configuration. They use Robocopy flags such as `/XC /XN /XO` (to copy only newer or non-existent files) when appropriate.
- **Deploy-Web, Deploy-PlayWatch, Deploy-CRYSTALControl, etc.:**  
  These functions are tailored for specific components. They use similar Robocopy commands, ensuring that the updated files are mirrored from the staging directory to their live locations (e.g., in `D:\OnlineData` or other designated paths).

Each deploy function typically:
- Determines the package folder within the prep directory by filtering with a pattern.
- Uses Robocopy to mirror or update the live folder.
- Generates a log file (named with a timestamp) in the logs directory.
- Displays the final part of the log for quick verification.

## 12. Usage Guidelines & Best Practices

1. **Importing the Toolkit:**  
   - Use PowerShell 7 and log in as an allowed user (e.g. ThomasLukas, Administrator, SysprepUser).  
   - The custom profile automatically imports the toolkit if `TK.key` is present.
2. **Remote Session Management:**  
   - Use the provided startup scripts and remote session functions (e.g. `Open-DB-Session`) to manage remote connections.
3. **Deployments & Updates:**  
   - Utilize the prep and deploy functions (see DevOps chapter) to stage and roll out updates.  
   - Always create backups of current configurations using backup functions (e.g. `Backup-GLXDir`).
4. **Oracle Operations:**  
   - Use the Oracle modules to check patch versions, update tnsnames.ora, export/import full schemas, and spool privileges.
5. **Sysprep Process:**  
   - Run `Modulus-Sysprep` (or use the sysprep startup script) to prepare a system for imaging.  
   - Ensure that legacy issues, registry settings, disk configurations, and NIC settings are correct before sysprep.
6. **CasinoChanger:**  
   - When `CC.key` is available, run `Execute-CasinoChanger` to update casino parameters interactively.
7. **Healthchecks:**  
   - Run the healthcheck functions to verify that live configurations match the expected (reference) versions.
8. **Security:**  
   - Keep key files (e.g. TK.key, SP.key, CC.key) secure and restrict access to the credential vault.
9. **Logging & Troubleshooting:**  
   - Check log files in the directories specified by your JSON configuration for troubleshooting information.
